/**
 * Write and test a program to complete the three tasks.
 * 
 * TASK 1
 * A data logger records the temperature on the roof of a school twice a day, at midday and midnight.
 * 
 * Input and store the temperatures recorded for a month. You must store the temperatures in two one-
 * dimensional arrays, one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperatures. All the
 * 
 * temperatures must be validated on entry and any invalid temperatures rejected. You must decide
 * your own validation rules. You may assume that there are 30 days in a month.
 * 
 * TASK 2
 * Calculate the average temperature for midday and the average temperature for midnight. Output
 * these averages with a suitable message for each one.
 * 
 * TASK 3
 * Select the day with the highest midday temperature and the day with the lowest midnight temperature.
 * Then output each of these temperatures, the corresponding day and a suitable message.
 * Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. Error messages and other
 * outputs need to be set out clearly and understandably. All variables, constants and other identifiers
 * must have meaningful names. Each task must be fully tested.
